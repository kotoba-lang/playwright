  "Browser-free tests for the two marshalling seams every browser call crosses:
   `->clj` (Playwright evaluate results -> Clojure data) and `clj->gson`/`gson->clj`
   (Clojure maps <-> CDP params, which is how add-virtual-authenticator configures
   a passkey).

   These assert STRUCTURE, not just value. Clojure's `=` considers a
   java.util.HashMap equal to a Clojure map and a java.util.ArrayList equal to a
   vector, so `(= {\"a\" [1 2]} java-map)` is true even when nothing was converted
   at all -- an `=`-only test here passes on an implementation that returns its
   input untouched. `map?` and `vector?` are what actually discriminate."
