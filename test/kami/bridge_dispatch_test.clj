(ns kami.bridge-dispatch-test
  "eval-page's three-way dispatch, exercised against a STUB bridge instead of a
   browser.

   The contract worth pinning is not 'a page can be evaluated' -- it is that the
   three outcomes stay TELLABLE APART:

     the browser answered            -> the result
     the browser reported an error   -> throws, carrying the JS error text
     the bridge never ran at all     -> throws, saying so

   If either failure path returned nil instead, a browser error and a bridge that
   was never installed would both look exactly like a successful eval that
   returned nothing. That is the failure mode CLAUDE.md names: a check that could
   not run returning the same value as a check that ran and found nothing wrong.

   No Playwright package and no chromium binary are needed here -- only node,
   which this repo already requires to reach a browser at all. Node's absence is
   asserted as its own failure below rather than quietly skipping the suite, so
   'did not run' can never be read off the output as 'passed'."
